//&These POST API'S AND Patch api's are the ones which are inserting some data into the database.How will you insert data into the database?Either some user registers onto your application,or if the user is trying to update his profile.These are basically the 2 api's where you basically need to have strict checks.Even before putting some checks inside these api's we should basically add some checks inside the database itself, inside the schema itself.

//~Let us now also talk about the API Level validations.First of all let me talk about what is the problem with our api's.Somebody is signing onto our platform, when the user is signing up, I donot need all the information about the user.I donot need the age of the user,I also donot even need the skills, I donot also need the photo id of the user.I donot need the lot of other things.Basically I just want to take 4 fields.Think about a UI where you have a Sign up form which asks for your firstName, your lastName, your emailId, your password and it just signs you up for the application.

//?Now also, suppose if I try to update the emailId of any user document, will I be able to do it ??Yes it will update it.But what if I donot want any of my users to update the emailId once he has registered.Because it will be a very big problem for us.emailId is a very sensitive thing.The user can then completely change his identity.Suppose if the user is signing up for the first time,they have given me some emailId,Now emailId change is not allowed.I donot want emailId to be changed when I am updating my user.For this I need to put the api level validation.

//!Even if i pass some random data "xyz": "sdsdsdsds", it will again say === user updated successfully.But inside the document no "xyz" field will be created because we have not defined that in our schema.I want if the user is updating his profile,he can only update the certain fields of the profile.Go to the PATCH API.

//&Suppose If I am adding a user and I did'nt pass a correct emailId suppose I passed my emailId as "qweerer" any random string not in the correct email format === and still the user will be successfully added.If you will not put validations for this then that will be a bad job for you.Validating an emailId is not a easy job.For validations you can also take the help of an external library and there is a very famous library known as npm validator.You can use this library and then you can validate your emailId very easily.Let us now install it using === "npm i validator".Now with this I can add a API level validation also and I can also add a db level validation.For now I am adding a schema level validation,for this Go to the User Schema.

//~Go to the user schema
